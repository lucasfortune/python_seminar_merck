    "### Introduction and Prerequisites\n",
    "In Python and many other programming languages, *object-oriented programming* consists of creating *classes* of *objects* that contain specific information and tools for their manipulation.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "All the tools we use for data science (*DataFrames, scikit-learn models, matplotlib*, ...) are built this way. Understanding the mechanics of Python objects and knowing how to use them is essential to be able to use all the features of these very useful tools.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Furthermore, object-oriented programming gives the developer the flexibility to adapt an object to their needs, thanks to *inheritance*, which we will look at in the second OOP notebook. This technique is frequently used to develop packages like **scikit-learn**, which allow a user to easily develop and evaluate the models they need.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "To approach these modules under the best possible conditions, it is important to have completed the *Introduction to Python Programming* module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 Introduction to Classes\n",
    "In Python, a class is defined as follows: <br>\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle: # Definition of the Vehicle class\n",
    "    def __init__(self, a, b = []):\n",
    "        self.seats = a                 # Number of seats in the vehicle\n",
    "        self.passengers = b            # List with passenger names\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def print_passengers(self):\n",
    "        for i in range(len(self.passengers)):\n",
    "            print(self.passengers[i])\n",
    "```\n",
    "```py\n",
    "car1 = Vehicle(4, ['Maria', 'Julie']) # Instantiation of an object of the Vehicle class\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code corresponds to the definition of a class called ```Vehicle```, which contains 2 pieces of information: the number of seats of the ```Vehicle``` in the variable **```seats```** and the names of the passengers aboard the ```Vehicle``` in the variable **```passengers```**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class contains a ```print_passengers``` *method*, which displays the names of the passengers aboard in the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement ```car1 = Vehicle(4, ['Maria', 'Julie'])``` corresponds to the *instantiation* of the ```Vehicle``` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes and Definitions\n",
    "* ```Vehicle``` is a *class* of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```car1``` is an *instance* of the ```Vehicle``` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```seats``` and ```passengers``` are called **attributes** of the ```Vehicle``` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The functions defined in the ```Vehicle``` class such as ```print_passengers``` and ```__init__``` are called **methods** of the ```Vehicle``` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ```__init__``` method takes as arguments the variables that will define the attributes of an instance when it is created.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<i class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"></i>\n",
    "The <code style=\"background-color: transparent; color: inherit\">__init__</code> method is automatically called when instantiating any class.\n",
    "</div><div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n",
    "<i class='fa fa-exclamation-triangle'></i>\n",
    "All methods defined within a class have the <code style=\"background-color: transparent; color: inherit\">self</code> argument as the first parameter. This parameter is used to specify the instance that called the method.\n",
    "<br></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Exercises:\n",
    "Based on the syntax of the ```Vehicle``` class defined above:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> (a) Define a new class ```Complex``` with 2 attributes:\n",
    "> * **```part_re```**, which contains the real part of a complex number\n",
    "> * **```part_im```**, which contains the imaginary part of a complex number <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> (b) Define in the ```Complex``` class a ```display``` method that outputs a ```Complex``` in its algebraic form *a Â± bi*. This method should adapt to the sign of the imaginary part (The method should be able to display ```4 - 2i```, ```6 + 2i```, ```5```, ...). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> (c) Instantiate two ```Complex``` objects corresponding to the complex numbers $4 + 5i$ and $3 - 2i$, and output them to the console."
