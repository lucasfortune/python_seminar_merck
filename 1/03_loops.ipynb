    "## 1 The while-Loop\n",
    "The ```while```-loop allows you to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. <br>\n",
    "Example: <br>\n",
    "To determine the index of the word ```\"found\"``` in a list of words, you can iterate through all indices of the list until you find the ```\"found\"``` string:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The word list in which we want to search for \"found\"\n",
    "sentence = ['The', 'while', 'loop', 'browses', 'all', 'the',\n",
    "            'elements', 'from', 'the', 'list', \"until\", 'it',\n",
    "            'has', 'found', 'what', 'it', 'seeks', '.']\n",
    "\n",
    "# The variable i stores the starting index\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# As long as the word at the current index is not \"found\"\n",
    "while sentence[i] != \"found\":\n",
    "    # We increase i by 1 to go to the next index\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# The loop stops when we have found the right word\n",
    "print(\"The word 'found' is at index\", i)\n",
    ">>> The word 'found' is at index 13\n",
    "```\n",
    "The general structure of a ```while```-loop looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition == True:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    statementN\n",
    "\n",
    "statement_after_loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "At each **iteration** of the ```while```-loop, the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the statement block is executed, otherwise the loop ends. <br>\n",
    "Lines outside the statement block do not belong to the loop and are only executed when the loop has ended. <br>\n",
    "If the condition is false from the beginning, the statement block is never executed. <br>\n",
    "If, on the other hand, the condition is always true, the statement block is executed infinitely. It is therefore important to ensure that the loop ends at some point."

    "The ```for```-loop allows you to repeat a statement block in a controlled manner. With a ```while```-loop, it's often unclear how many times it will be executed. <br>\n",
    "The ```for```-loop, on the other hand, is very explicit about the variable that is changed on each iteration. Additionally, the number of loop iterations is always finite. <br>\n",

    "for element in sequence:\n",
    "    statement1\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    statementN\n",
    "    \n",
    "further_statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "The ```for```-loop executes the statement block for each ```element``` in the ```sequence```. <br>\n",
    "As with the ```while```-loop, lines outside the statement block do not belong to the loop and are only executed when the loop has ended. <br>\n",
    "The execution follows this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variable ```element``` takes the value of the first element of the ```sequence```\n",
    "- The statement block is executed\n",
    "- The variable ```element``` takes the value of the second element of the ```sequence```\n",
    "- The statement block is executed\n",
    "- ...\n",

    "- The ```further_statement``` is executed\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```sequence``` object can be any type of indexable object, such as a ```list```, a ```tuple```, a ```string```, etc. <br>\n",
    "In the ```for```-loop, you don't need to change the ```element``` variable yourself, Python takes care of it automatically. However, make sure you don't forget the keywords ```in``` and ```:``` as they are essential."

    "Let's say we want to store the first 10 square numbers in a list. For this we could create an empty list as before and use a ```for```-loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = []\n",

    "# For i from 0 to 9\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [i**2 for i in range(10)]\n",
    "```\n",
