    " In addition to the usual mathematical operations, `numpy` arrays also have several [methods](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.12.0/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#array-methods) for more complex array operations.\n",
    " One of the most commonly used operations is the **`mean`** method of an array for calculating the average: <br>\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " A = np.array([[1, 1, 10],\n",
    "               [3, 5, 2]])\n",
    "\n",

    " print(A.mean(axis = 0))\n",
    " >>> [2, 3, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    " # Calculation of the mean value of each row of X\n",
    " print(A.mean(axis = 1))\n",
    " >>> [4, 3.33]\n",
    " ```\n",
    " The **`axis`** argument specifies **which dimension is traversed** to calculate the mean: <br>\n",
    " * If `axis = 0`, the operation is performed along the **rows** and returns **the average of each column**. <br>\n",
    " * If `axis = 1`, the operation is performed along the **columns** and returns **the average of each row**. <br>\n",
    " <img src=\"../imgs/mean_axis.png\" style=\"height:350px\"> <br>\n",
    " The `axis` argument is **very frequently** used for operations on matrices, and **not only with `numpy`**. <br>\n",
    " There are other functions that use the `axis` argument, such as: <br>\n",
    " * **`sum`**: Calculates the sum of the elements in an array. <br>\n",
    " * **`std`**: Calculates the standard deviation. <br>\n",
    " * **`min`**: Finds the minimum **value** among the elements in an array. <br>\n",
    " * **`max`**: Finds the maximum **value** among the elements of an array. <br>\n",
    " * **`argmin`**: Returns the index of the minimum **value**. <br>\n",
    " * **`argmax`**: Returns the index of the maximum **value**. <br>\n",
    " In general, we use the value **`axis = 0`** to obtain the result **for each column**, i.e., **for each variable in the database**. <br>\n",
    " This allows us to calculate min-max normalization very quickly using the **`min`** and **`max`** methods together with **broadcasting**: <br>\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " X_tilde = (X - X.min(axis = 0))/(X.max(axis = 0) - X.min(axis = 0))\n",

    " The [Mean Squared Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) is a metric used to quantify the prediction error obtained from a regression model. This term will be covered in more detail later in your training. <br>\n",
    " The formula for the mean squared error, abbreviated as $\\mathrm{MSE}$, is calculated using the following formula: <br>\n",
    " $$ \\mathrm{MSE} = \\frac 1 n \\sum_{i=1}^n(\\hat y_i - y_i)^2 $$ <br>\n",

    " $$\\hat y = X \\beta$$ <br>\n",
